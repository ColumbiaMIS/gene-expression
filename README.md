# gene-expression
Gene Expression Learnathon - 2/11/2017
Slides for the workshops: tinyurl.com/cumis-gene-expression

Workshop 1: Intro to Gene Expression Data and Coding in R- an intro-level overview of how gene expression data are collected and typical gene expression data formats, followed by an introduction to coding in R.

Workshop 2: Bioconductor and Exploration of GEO datasets -From this point on you will be able to explore datasets you think would be cool to work with, and are free to relocate to the breakout room and brainstorm project ideas. 

Workshop 3: Machine Learning Tools and Biological Knowledge Discovery- we will briefly cover some basic tools of machine learning (decision trees, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, k-means), and some knowledge-discovery approaches specific to gene expression data (differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and brief discussion of Genome-Wide Association Studies and ChIP-seq)
